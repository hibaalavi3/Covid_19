# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

A data analysis project exploring the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data). The project analyzes the spread, fatalities, and vaccination progress across countries to uncover global patterns and disparities in pandemic response.

## Key Features

-  **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Handled missing values and filtered out aggregate regions (e.g., "World", "Asia").
  - Calculated derived metrics: cases/deaths per million, vaccination percentage.

-  **Visualizations & Insights**
  - Bar charts for top countries by total cases, deaths per million, and vaccination rate.
  - Line plot showing global daily trends in cases and deaths.
  - Advanced analysis of case fatality rates and vaccination rollout speed.
  - Monthly normalized trends to reveal pandemic waves.

-  **Advanced Analytics**
  - Identified countries with fastest vaccination rollouts.
  - Compared case fatality rates (CFR) across countries with >100k cases.
  - Normalized trends to visualize severity vs mortality lag.

## Key Insights

- The U.S., India, and Brazil led in total reported cases, but smaller nations had higher per capita burdens.
- Countries like Peru and Mexico showed alarming death rates per million, indicating overwhelmed healthcare systems.
- Nations with high early vaccination rates (e.g., Israel, Portugal) saw lower mortality and faster recovery.
- The global death rate decoupled from new cases post-vaccination, suggesting strong vaccine effectiveness.
